There are some useful I/O classes for parsing/reading/writing formulas and other data structures.

## Parsers

Parsers are used to parse formula strings into LogicNG [formulas](../formulas).  Throughout the documentation, we used the default parser on formula factories by calling `#!java f.parse(...)`, but we can also generate parsers by hand or - most important - implement own parsers for our applications.

Parsers in LogicNG are generated by the parser framework [ANTRL](https://www.antlr.org/) (LogicNG's only external dependency).  You only define a grammar file and ANTLR generates the Java classes for the parser at compile time.  LogicNG's parser grammars lie [here](https://github.com/logic-ng/LogicNG/tree/master/src/main/antlr).  There are two parsers:

1. [PropositionalParser](https://github.com/logic-ng/LogicNG/blob/master/src/main/java/org/logicng/io/parsers/PropositionalParser.java) for parsing propositional formulas without cardinality or pseudo-Boolean constraints.  Its grammar can be found [here](https://github.com/logic-ng/LogicNG/blob/master/src/main/antlr/LogicNGPropositional.g4)
2. [PseudoBooleanParser](https://github.com/logic-ng/LogicNG/blob/master/src/main/java/org/logicng/io/parsers/PseudoBooleanParser.java) for parsing formulas with cardinality or pseudo-Boolean constraints.

!!! tip "Application Insight"

    You can easily implement you own parsers for you propositional language by looking at these grammar files and implementing your own parser inheriting from [FormulaParser](https://github.com/logic-ng/LogicNG/blob/master/src/main/java/org/logicng/io/parsers/FormulaParser.java).  Then you only need to write minimal code.


## Readers

There are two formula readers implemented in LogicNG:

- [DIMACS reader](https://github.com/logic-ng/LogicNG/blob/master/src/main/java/org/logicng/io/readers/DimacsReader.java) for reading CNF files as used in the SAT competition in the [DIMACS CNF format](http://beyondnp.org/static/media/uploads/docs/satformat.pdf).
- [Formula reader](https://github.com/logic-ng/LogicNG/blob/master/src/main/java/org/logicng/io/readers/FormulaReader.java) for reading files in LogicNG syntax from a file.

The formula reader can read propositional formulas with or without pseudo-Boolean constraints.  Multiple lines in a file are interpreted as a conjunction of the formulas in each line.


## Writers

There are three writers for formulas in the `org.logicng.io` package:

- [DIMACS writer](https://github.com/logic-ng/LogicNG/blob/master/src/main/java/org/logicng/io/writers/FormulaDimacsFileWriter.java) for writing CNFs as DIMACS CNF files like described above.
- [Formula writer](https://github.com/logic-ng/LogicNG/blob/master/src/main/java/org/logicng/io/writers/FormulaWriter.java) for writing formulas in LogicNG syntax.  The formula writer has the option `splitAndMultiline` which, if set to `true`, writes the different operands of a top-level conjunction in single lines.  This can often improve readability, and the corresponding `FormulaReader` can read this format.
- [Formula dot file writer](https://github.com/logic-ng/LogicNG/blob/master/src/main/java/org/logicng/io/writers/FormulaDotFileWriter.java) for writing a graphical representation of formulas as a [DOT file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)).  Such a file can be used to generate a graphical representation e.g. with [Graphviz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz).  E.g. the graphics in the chapter on [formulas](../formulas) were generated this way.  The parameter `alignLiterals` allows to align all literals of a formula at the same level, meaning all terminal nodes are at the same level.

Other data structures have also their own writers.


### BDDs

Graphs of a [BDD](../knowledge-compilation/bdd) can be written as DOT file with the [BDD dot file writer](https://github.com/logic-ng/LogicNG/blob/master/src/main/java/org/logicng/knowledgecompilation/bdds/io/BDDDotFileWriter.java).  The graphics of BDDs in this documentation were generated this way.


### Graphs

For [graphs](../graphs), there are two writers:

- [DIMACS writer](https://github.com/logic-ng/LogicNG/blob/master/src/main/java/org/logicng/graphs/io/GraphDimacsFileWriter.java) for writing a [DIMACS graph file](https://github.com/akinanop/mvl-solver/wiki/DIMACS-Graph-Format) of the graph.
- [Graph dot file writer](https://github.com/logic-ng/LogicNG/blob/master/src/main/java/org/logicng/graphs/io/GraphDotFileWriter.java) for writing a dot file of the graph.  The graphics of graphs in this documentation were generated this way.
