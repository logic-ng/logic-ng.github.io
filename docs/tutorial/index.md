title: LogicNG Tutorial
---

This tutorial offers a gentle introduction into the usage and algorithms of LogicNG. We accompany Beatrice, the founder of a bike shop, by facing different incidents.

Along this, we proceed from modelling a real-world problem into a configuration problem that can be solved with LogicNG to using the efficient SAT- and MaxSAT-solvers in LogicNG.

In the tutorial, you will see applications for the following content:

- Formulate a real-world problem in LogicNG-syntax in [chapter 1](chapter1)
- Different operations that you can perform on formulas, such as substituting the formulas or restricting the ruleset in [chapter 2](chapter2)
- An example for formula functions for analyzing the rule set in [chapter 3](chapter3)
- Propositions, what they are and how to use them in [chapter 4](chapter4)
- SAT Solving, including backbones, explanations and model enumeration and counting in [chapter 5](chapter5)
- MaxSAT Solving in [chapter 6](chapter6)

The code for this can be found under [doc/tutorial/BicycleShopTutorial.java](https://github.com/logic-ng/LogicNG/blob/master/doc/tutorial/BicycleShopTutorial.java). Have fun!
